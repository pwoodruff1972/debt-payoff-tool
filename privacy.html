            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 10, 2025</p>

            <p>Your privacy is our top priority. This Privacy Policy explains our commitment to protecting your data when you use the Debt Payoff Planner website and tool.</p>

            <h3>The Core Principle: We Don't Collect Your Data</h3>
            <p>The Debt Payoff Planner is a client-side application. This means it runs entirely within your web browser on your own computer. We have designed the tool so that we do not have user accounts, servers, or databases to store your personal or financial information.</p>
            
            <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
            <p>Any financial data you enter into the tool—such as debt names, balances, interest rates, or payment amounts—is stored exclusively on your own device using your browser's Local Storage. This data is **never** transmitted to, or stored on, our servers. We do not have access to it.</p>
            <p>If you choose to use the "Export to File" feature, your data is saved as a file directly on your computer. You have full control over that file.</p>

            <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Website Hosting:</strong> Our website is hosted on Netlify. Netlify may collect standard, anonymous analytics data, such as the number of visitors to our site.
            </p>
             <p>
                <strong>Payments:</strong> If you choose to upgrade to the Pro version, your payment is processed by Gumroad, a secure third-party payment processor. We do not receive or store your credit card information. Your transaction is subject to Gumroad's privacy policy.
            </p>

            <h3>Contacting Us</h3>
            <p>If you contact us via email, we will use your email address solely to respond to your inquiry. We will not sell your email address or add you to any marketing lists without your explicit consent.</p>

            <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page.</p>
